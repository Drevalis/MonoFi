## 📌 About

This is a small side project created by me.  
I'm still a beginner in programming and currently learning Python.  
The goal is to automate some common WiFi-related tasks using Python and command-line tools.

The code is not perfect – I'm not a great coder – but I’m sharing it in case others find it useful or want to learn from it.
